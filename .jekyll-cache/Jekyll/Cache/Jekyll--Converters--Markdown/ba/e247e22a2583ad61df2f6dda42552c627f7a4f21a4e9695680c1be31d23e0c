I"ð<p>In temperate latitudes, identification of the environmental drivers behind epidemics can be confounded by the mutual correlation between a broad set of hypothesized causal variables. In contrast, the low or altogether absent correlation between hypothesized causes and effects in tropical latitudes can obscure the presence of physical-biological coupling. EDM analysis has teased apart conflicting hypotheses and led to improvements in actionable forecasts for both influenza and dengue.</p>
