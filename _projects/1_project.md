Motivating Questions:

- How do we quantify resilience away from equilibrium?

- Inductive approach to modeling benthic community interactions and identifying nonlinear feedbacks.

	When is restoration “complete”?

- How can we predict and affect trajectories of recovery across dimensions of reef ecosystem services and fundamental ecosystem health?
